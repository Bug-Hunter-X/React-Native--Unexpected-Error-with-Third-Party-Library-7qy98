The solution focuses on proper installation, configuration, and verification of the third-party library.  This includes:

1. **Verify Library Installation:**  Double-check that the library is correctly installed via npm or yarn. Use `npm list RNMyLibrary` or `yarn why RNMyLibrary` to see the dependency tree and ensure no conflicting versions exist.
2. **Check Compatibility:**  Consult the library's documentation for compatibility with your React Native version.  If necessary, update the library or adjust your React Native version.
3. **Link Native Modules (if applicable):**  Many libraries require linking native modules, which involves running specific commands.  Follow the library's instructions carefully.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve issues.  Try `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or the yarn equivalent.   Then, rebuild your app.
5. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Ensure you do not have conflicting versions of other packages. 
6. **Update React Native and related packages:** Keeping everything up-to-date is crucial.  Update React Native and potentially any core dependencies.
7. **Examine the error message:**  Even generic error messages provide clues.  See if the library provides troubleshooting tips or community forum threads related to this error.

The corrected code would then correctly initialize and use the third-party library without errors.
