This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly configured or compatible with the current version of React Native. It is often related to native modules that fail to initialize or link correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  The error message itself might not be very specific, making debugging more challenging. For example, you might see a generic error like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'RNMyLibrary.someMethod')`  where `RNMyLibrary` represents a third-party library.
