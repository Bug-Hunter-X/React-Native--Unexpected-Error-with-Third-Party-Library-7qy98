# React Native: Unexpected Error with Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development where an unexpected error occurs due to problems integrating a third-party library. The problem often arises from incorrect library configuration or compatibility issues with the React Native version.  The error manifests as a generic JavaScript error, making it difficult to diagnose.

**Problem:** The app might crash or exhibit erratic behavior, and error messages aren't very helpful.  The example shows an error like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'RNMyLibrary.someMethod')`, indicating a failure to access a method within the third-party library.

**Solution:** The solution involves verifying the library's installation, compatibility, and proper integration with the React Native project.  This might involve checking the library's documentation, verifying dependencies, confirming correct linking of native modules (if applicable), and updating the library or React Native itself if necessary.
